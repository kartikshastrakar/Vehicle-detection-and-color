## **Car Detection using Background Subtraction**

Background subtraction is a simple yet effective technique to extract objects from an image/video. Consider a highway on which cars are moving, and you want to extract each car. One easy way can be that you take a picture of the highway with the cars (called foreground image) then you also have an image saved in which the highway does not contain any cars (background image) and then you subtract the background image from the foreground to get the segmented mask of the cars and then use that mask to extract the cars.
The sample output is shown below.
